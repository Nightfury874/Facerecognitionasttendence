# Facerecognitionasttendence
A face recognition based attendance system. 
It allows to mark the attendance of students through open CV
Students are seperated on the basis of their class or section and the system can recognise them with their own ID and class
The attendance is saved in excel file and is constantly updated
The data is then sent to nother online management system stored in online server where the attendance is marked
and further actions like attendance %, sms to parents etc are carried out.
This may be also implemented during online examinations.
This system finds it's use in gyms and malls too.
